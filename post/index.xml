      <description>Using R and Python Together What could possibly be cooler then knowing how to code in R? Knowing how to code in both R and Python of course!
Would you believe me if I said that there was a way to combine both languages within the same code chunk?
Well, I have wonderful news for you! Using the reticulate package, it is possible to seamlessly share information and communicate between the two languages.</description>

      <description>Using Python Strings are not a unique feature to the Python program, however it differs from other programs in that Python is very flexible with its string operations. Strings are arrays and have a length of 1, so the position of the characters is impertive in returning the correct code! An example of how strings work in Python is depicted below.
 Example: See below: &#39;first&#39; and &#39;last&#39; returns the desired code.</description>
