### Using R and Python Together

What could possibly be cooler then knowing how to code in R? Knowing how to code in both R and Python of course! 

Would you believe me if I said that there was a way to combine both languages within the same code chunk?

Well, I have wonderful news for you! Using the reticulate package, it is possible to seamlessly share information and communicate between the two languages. The reticulate function allows R values to be read in as Python values when called into Python. When the values are returned from Python to R, they get converted back to a format that is compatible in R. It is fascinating how this works!




####Example: UT Royalty

I provided an example below to depict how this communication may look in action.


The following code was done in R and will be important in the next step when trying to retrieve R values in a Python code chunk
```{r}
library(reticulate)
king<-"Bevo"
```

In the code below, the R-defined object 'king' can be retrieved in Python by using the 'r.' notation
```{python}
royalty="is my ride or die"
print(r.king,royalty)
```

Similarly, a Python-defined object can be retrieved within an R code chunk using the 'py$' notation. Notice how the code below produces the same message as the code above- all thanks to the reticulate function!
```{r}
cat(c(king,py$royalty))
```
